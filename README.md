# ADIDAS SALE IN FLORIDA WITH ‘Men’s Street Footwear’ ANALYST-STATISTICAL METHOD(IT151IU)

This project presents an analysis of the relationship between price per unit and the number of units sold. The primary objective is to understand how pricing strategies impact sales volume and to identify trends and patterns that can inform future pricing decisions. The analysis uses historical Florida Adidas sales with Men’s Streetwear data from a 2020-2021 period, examining variations in unit prices and corresponding sales volumes.

## Object 
- We have used many measures and performed many tests to determine the best and most suitable variables for describing the relation between Units Sold and Price per Unit. We have chosen these variables to analyze and execute hypothesis tests: State,Product,Units Sold,Price per Unit.

- Price per Unit and Units Sold are both discrete variable, State and Product are nominal variable
  
  - Explanatory variable: Units Sold
  - Response Variable: Price per Unit

## Goal 
- Analyzing data to find patterns, trends, and the correlation between Price per Unit and Units sold.
  
- Implementing knowledge and skills learned from the Statistical Methods course to collect and understand the data thoroughly.
  
- Understanding more about how datasets really work in reality.
